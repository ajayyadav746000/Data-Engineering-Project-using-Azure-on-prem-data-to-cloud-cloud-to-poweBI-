# Data-Engineering-Project-using-Azure-on-prem-data-to-cloud-cloud-to-poweBI-
 Data engineering project on Azure that involved moving data from on-premise SQL Server to Azure Data Lake through Data Factory. 
 Using Databricks and Spark, I transformed the data before loading it into Synapse. 
 The final step included setting up PowerBI for reporting, providing stakeholders with valuable insights.



 The AdventureWorks database, freely available online and provided by Microsoft, serves as a sample database to illustrate the design of a SQL server database, originally demonstrated with SQL Server 2008. It showcases the structure of a database supporting a fictional manufacturing multinational corporation named Adventure Works Cycles.

This database is specifically designed for Online Transaction Processing (OLTP), a type of data processing involving concurrent transactions. Microsoft ships the AdventureWorks database with their SQL server products.

In the context of this project, I utilized the Lightweight (LT) data, a streamlined version of the OLTP sample, to ensure efficiency and simplicity. You can download the LT data here.

## Project Objectives:

1. Establish a connection between an on-premise SQL server and Azure cloud.
2. Ingest tables into Azure Data Lake for efficient storage and accessibility.
3. Apply data cleaning and transformation processes using Azure Databricks.
4. Utilize Azure Synapse Analytics to load the cleaned data for further analysis.
5. Create interactive data visualizations and reports using Microsoft Power BI for effective insights.
6. Implement Azure Active Directory (AAD) and Azure Key Vault for robust monitoring and governance of the data pipeline.

These goals outline the key steps in setting up a comprehensive data engineering project on the Azure cloud.
